# Guess-number-name

This is a simple number guessing game written in Python. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 20, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the program gives a hint whether the number is higher or lower. Once the player guesses correctly, the game shows how many attempts it took and asks if the player wants to play again.
